Constructors in C++ - Types and Usage
Aim
The aim of this C++ program is to illustrate different types of constructors in a class: default constructor, parameterized constructor, and copy constructor. The program creates instances of the demo class using these constructors and displays the data members.

Theory
In C++, constructors are special member functions that are used to initialize objects of a class. There are several types of constructors, including:

Default Constructor: A constructor that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object's data members to default values.
Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that accepts parameters and is used to initialize the object's data members with specific values.
Copy Constructor: A constructor that is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.
Algorithm
This program follows these steps:

Define a class called demo with a private data member a.
Create the following constructors in the demo class:
Default Constructor (demo()) that initializes a to 10.
Parameterized Constructor (demo(int x)) that sets a to the provided value x.
Copy Constructor (demo(demo& aa)) that copies the value of a from another object of the same class.
Define a member function putdata() that displays the value of a.
In the main function, create three objects of the demo class using different constructors:
Object aa is created using the default constructor.
Object bb is created using the parameterized constructor with a value of 20.
Object cc is created using the copy constructor with the object aa.
Call the putdata() function for each object to display the value of a.
Conclusion
This program serves as an educational tool to demonstrate various types of constructors in C++ classes. Constructors are essential for initializing objects and ensuring they are in a valid state for further operations.

The default constructor sets initial values, which is helpful when no specific values are provided during object creation.
The parameterized constructor allows objects to be initialized with user-defined values.
The copy constructor creates a new object with the same values as an existing object, providing a way to duplicate objects.
Understanding constructors is crucial for object-oriented programming in C++. Constructors ensure that objects are correctly initialized and ready to use in your programs.

This README file provides an explanation of constructors in C++ and their different types. It helps users understand the purpose and usage of constructors within the context of a class.
